# Quiz Quiz

For my Second Project on Code Institute's Diploma in Software Developement course I have created a Quiz Game.

You can check out the game by clicking [HERE](https://rlorimier.github.io/quizquiz/)

I underestimated the JavaScript lessons and did not take them as serious as I should. For that reason my project is finalized but not exactly the way I have imagined when I started. I also did not use properly the tolls I have available for support (mentor, tutor, slack community) and for that I fully regret. I managed to finish this project working hard on the last day and I am not proud of that.

  3) On my GitHub Desktop, selected Add and then Clone a repository.
  4) On my Visual Studio Code (VSC), selected Open Folder and then selected the new created folder to start coding.

- The steps to commit and push commits:
  1) Every alteration on the files was being saved automatically.
  2) GitHub Desktop is connected with VSC and showns every changes made on the files.
  3) After every significant amount of coding is time for local commits:
     - On GitHub Desktop, type in a name for the commit and click Commit to Main.
  4) After a work day, the last local commit is done and then click in Push Origim to commit all local commits to GitHub repository.

- To Deploy:

  2) On the left side menu, click Pages.
  3) At Source, select the option Main and then Save.
  4) The page is reloaded and will show the link for your website. The link takes a few minutes to work properly.
